/*
An object is piece of memory that can be used to store data.
An object with name is called variable
properties are represented as objects while behaviour is represented by functions
Class invariant is a condition that must be true throughout the lifetime of an object in order for the object to
remain in a valid state

Compiler goes from top to bottom 
So function needs to be first declared before using them
But in structs such an order does not matter but the use of variables might affect
what it does is just convert them into forward declarations and then at the end there is list of complete definitions

If the struct do not have any data then instead of creating objects it is good practice to use namespace to directly 
access the functions

In classes we have by default private declarations

Getter (accessors) -> return value of private members
setter (mutators) -> that set value of private members (mutators are broad term meaning it can modify the object)

member function have same rule for returning by reference as non member functions , returning value should not get 
destroyed after the function ends
third case is returning the data member -> if by value it can be expensive
it is safe to return these by refernce

constructors generally perform two functions:
They typically perform initialization of any member variables (via a member initialization list)
They may perform other setup functions (via statements in the body of the constructor). This might include things 
such as error checking the initialization values, opening a file or database, etcâ€¦

constructors are only for non aggregate type data

Constructors have same name as the class and no return type and are usually public
it do the implicit conversions

const effect of an object comes only after object is created not while it is under construction
